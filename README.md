# Selfhosted Containers

A lightweight, self-contained environment for testing and experimenting with software engineering microservices — including identity providers, databases, frontends, and CI/CD tooling — all running locally in containers.  

This repo is designed for developers, solution architects, and learners who want to simulate production-like components without relying on external cloud services.

- Basic understanding of container management concepts (images, containers, volumes, networking).
