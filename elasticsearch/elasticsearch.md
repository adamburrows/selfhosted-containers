# Elasticsearch and Kibana Demo

This demo showcases how to deploy and visualize data using **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana**.

**Elasticsearch** is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for speed, scalability, and near real-time data exploration.  
**Kibana** is a visualization and analytics tool that lets you query, explore, and create interactive dashboards on top of Elasticsearch indices.  

Together, they provide an end-to-end solution for ingesting structured or unstructured data and visualizing insights through dashboards and graphs.
