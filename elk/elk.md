# ELK Demo

This demo showcases how **Logstash** ingests and transforms data from multiple sources, **Elasticsearch** indexes and searches the processed data, and **Kibana** provides interactive visualizations and dashboards to explore and analyze it.

**Elasticsearch** is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for speed, scalability, and near real-time data exploration.  
**Logstash** is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to a destination such as Elasticsearch.
**Kibana** is a visualization and analytics tool that lets you query, explore, and create interactive dashboards on top of Elasticsearch indices. 

Together, they provide an end-to-end solution for ingesting, processing, and visualizing data.
